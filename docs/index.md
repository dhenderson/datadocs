- Data documentation

- etc.

Whatever you call it, Datadocs is a way of documenting it.

# Getting started with Datadocs

See the `README.md` file for detailed documentation for getting started. You should however clear out the contents of `/docs`, including this file, and put in your own documentation files. You should however get started by deleting the contents of this `index.md` file and writing your own documentation index page here.
